## Notes/Ideas
 - PostCSS vs CSS-Loader?
 - Why hold much state/data in UI rather than display from server on page load?
    - Pros:
      - Speed for user (when results can be preloaded)
      - Saves money in server computation costs to create UI/remember state
    - Cons:
      - Lots of bandwidth to deliver Single Page App
      - Can be slower when building large UI after data call
    - Overall: Save state/preload data in client to improve user experience. Use server for speed
      - Use client when small objects can be stored/edited and returned
      - Use server for displayed only data
    - Redux for sharing state between client/server
    - When should we vs static webpages? React/React Static?
 - Backbone for UI? Seems simpler than react? Doesn't rely/revolve around instant response to interaction
