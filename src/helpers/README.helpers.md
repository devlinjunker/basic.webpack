# Helpers
This project contains a `helpers/` directory that holds Javascript classes that can be used across multiple
projects with utility methods for useful functionality.

## LocalStorage
The localstorage helper ([github](https://github.com/devlinjunker/template.webpack.fend/blob/master/src/helpers/localStorage.helper.js))
contains methods for saving/retrieving values with the browser localstorage API. Values saved with this will be
stored on the clients browser and can be retreived when they return to the web application (until they clear
their browser localstorage/data).
