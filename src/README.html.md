# HTML
HTML files structure the layout of the web application. The final HTML files are generated by webpack and
output to the `public/` directory when building with `npm run build`.


## Webpack
The webpack.config.js file defines the HTML pages that will be generated by the build process. For each instance
of the HtmlWebpackPlugin in the `plugins` section, webpack will output a new HTML file using the `template` at
the `filename` provided (inside of `public/`).

## HTML Linting
During the build process, webpack is configured to lint the final HTML files after each successful build with
[htmlhint](https://github.com/htmlhint/HTMLHint) to spot any errors in the HTML structure. This will cause an
error in the build process output. You can see the rules defined in the .htmlhintrc file ([github](https://github.com/devlinjunker/template.webpack.fend/blob/master/.htmlhintrc)).

These include:
 - Requiring Doctype
 - Disabling Inline CSS Styles on elements
 - Attribute naming conventions
 - Requiring some accessibility attributes
